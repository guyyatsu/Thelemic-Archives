The Fortieth Spirit is Raum. He is a Great Earl; and appeareth at first in the Form of a  Crow,  but after the Command of the Exorcist he putteth on Human Shape. His office is to steal Treasures out  [of]  King's Houses, and to carry it whither he is commanded, and to destroy Cities and Dignities of Men, and to tell all things, Past, and what Is, and what Will Be; and to cause Love between Friends and Foes. He  was of the Order of  Thrones. He governeth 30 Legions of  Spirits; and his Seal is this, which wear thou as aforesaid.
