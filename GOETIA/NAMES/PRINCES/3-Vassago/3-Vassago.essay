The Third Spirit is a Mighty Prince, being of the same nature as Agares.

He is  called  Vassago. 

This  Spirit  is  of  a  Good Nature, and his office is  to declare things Past 
and to Come, and to discover all things Hid or Lost.

And he  governeth  26 Legions  of Spirits, and this is his Seal.
