The Twelfth Spirit is Sitri.

He is a Great Prince, and appeareth at first with a Leop­ard's head
and the Wings of a Gryphon, but after the command of the Master of the Exorcism
he putteth on Human shape, and that very beautiful.

He enflameth men with Women's love, and Women with Men's love;
and causeth them also to show themselves naked if it be desired.

He gov­erneth 60 Legions of Spirits.

His Seal is this, to be worn as a Lamen before thee, etc.
