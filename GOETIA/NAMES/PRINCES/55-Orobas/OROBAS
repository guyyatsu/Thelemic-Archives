I beseech favor with the Great Deacon known as Orobas, I offer communion and a hand in fair game as well as two different smokes.

I accept, deal three. Highest value wins, two out of three.

Straight wands for Guy, with Orobas in second with a 6-3-1 of Wands, Swords, and Pantacles respectively. Now draw one more apiece and I'll tell you something real.

5 of Cups, 7 of Disks, 7 of ?

Five is yours, Seen is mine. Your Father taught you dissappointment, the natural progression
of that path leads to failure; most likely why you have NOT crossed the Abyss yet.
Despite your efforts you still pull too much influence from {FIND HEBREW WORD}.
Balance with BINAH and only dip up seems to be the only prescription.
Tell me where it hurts, you said you wanted to protect your next house? No.
THERE is {BETH}, protection of there comes from {AYIN}.

Yaweh Jehova, Man-Gotti Lombardi-Supernova thats some good weed.
Your people never cease to amaze me with your feats of genetic engineering. You have almost
cured hunger, if you would only forgo your unholy fixation to the wands greed.
Where is your heart? I heard that it's at the bottom of about 30,000 leagues below.
Call me one time and I'll show you power. Capricorns Spirit provides four walls within which
to work. Take note of your father, though for although therein lies the key to all undoing there also stays the path toward luxury as you know through swordsmanship.
As such, you stand at the precarious balance with which to find saitey through your own
minding. Your light shines upon the un-initiated, BE their Beacon in these trying times,
they acknowledge your Works.

Always protect your mind. Arrogance leads to Ruin, never poison yourself with your
own ambition.
