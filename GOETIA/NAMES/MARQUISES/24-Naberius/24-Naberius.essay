The Twenty-fourth Spirit is Naberius.

He is a most valiant Marquis, and showeth in the form of a Black Crane
fluttering about the Circle, and when he speaketh it is with a hoarse voice.

He maketh men cunning in all Arts and Sciences, but especially in the Art of Rhetoric.

He restoreth lost Dignities and Honours.

He governeth 19 Legions of Spirits.

His Seal is this, which is to be worn, etc.
