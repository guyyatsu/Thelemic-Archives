The Thirty-seventh Spirit is Phenex (or Pheynix). He is a Great Marquis, and appeareth like the Bird Phcenix, having the Voice of a  Child. He singeth many sweet notes before the Exorcist, which he must not regard, but by­and-by he  must bid  him put  on  Human Shape. Then will he speak marvellously of all wonderful Sciences if required. He is a Poet, good and excel­lent. And he  will be  willing to  perform thy requests. He hath hopes also to return to the Sev-Figure 69. The Seal of Phenex. enth Throne after 1,200 years more, as he said unto Solomon. He gov­erneth 20 Legions of Spirits. And his Seal is this, which wear thou, etc.
