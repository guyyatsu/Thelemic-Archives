The Thirty-second Spirit is Asmoday, or  Asmodai. He  is  a  Great King, Strong, and  Powerful. He appeareth with  Three Heads, whereof the first is like a Bull, the second like a Man, and the third like a Ram; he hath also the  tail  of  a  Serpent, and  from his  mouth issue Flames of Fire. His Feet are webbed like those of a Goose. He sitteth upon an Infernal Dragon, and beareth in his hand a Lance with a Banner. He is first and choicest under the Power of AMAYMON, 43 Figure 58. The Seal of Asmoday. he goeth before all other. When the Exorcist hath a mind to call him, let it be abroad, and let him stand on his feet all the time of action, with his Cap or Head-dress off; for if it be on, AMAYMON will deceive him and  call  all  his  actions to  be  bewrayed. But  as  soon as  the  Exorcist seeth Asmoday in the shape aforesaid, he shall call him by his Name, saying:  "Art thou Asmoday?" and he will not deny it, and by-and-by he will bow down unto the ground. He giveth the Ring of Virtues; he teacheth the Arts of Arithmetic, Astronomy,  Geometry, and all handiÂ­crafts absolutely. He giveth true and full answers unto thy  demands. He maketh one Invincible. He showeth the place where Treasures lie, and guardeth it. He, amongst the Legions of AMAYMON governeth 72 Legions of Spirits Inferior. His Seal is this which thou must wear as a Lamen upon thy breast, etc.
