The First  Principal Spirit is a King ruling in the East, called Bael.

He maketh thee to go Invisible.

He ruleth over 66 Legions of Infernal Spirits.

He appeareth in divers shapes, sometimes like a Cat, sometimes like a Toad, and sometimes 
like  a  Man,  and  sometimes  all  these  forms  at once.

He speaketh hoarsely.

This is his  character which is  used to  be worn  as  a  Lamen  before him 
who calleth  him forth,  or else he will not do thee homage.
