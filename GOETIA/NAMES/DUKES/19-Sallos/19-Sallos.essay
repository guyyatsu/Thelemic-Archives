The Nineteenth Spirit is Sallos, or Saleos.

He is a Great and Mighty Duke, and appeareth in the form of
a gallant Soldier riding on a Crocodile, with a Ducal
Crown on his head, but peaceably.

He causeth the Love of Women to Men, and of Men to Women;
and governeth 30 Legions of Spirits.

His Seal is this, etc.
