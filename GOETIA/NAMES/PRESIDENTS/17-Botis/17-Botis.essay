The Seventeenth Spirit is Botis, a Great President, and an Earl.

He appeareth at the first show in the form of an ugly Viper,
then at the command of the Magician he putteth on a Human shape with Great Teeth,
and two Horns, carrying a bright and sharp Sword in his hand.

He telleth all things Past, and to Come, and recÂ­oncileth Friends and Foes.

He ruleth over 60 Legions of Spirits, and this is his Seal, etc.
